    "### Introduction and Project Description:\n",
    "Analysis of neighborhoods in Scarborough ( Toronto ) based on the distribution of various facilities in and around that neighborhood to help the new Neighbors to take a better decision on choosing the best neighborhood out of Scarborough.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of this project is to help the new neighbors to explore the various neighborhoods before actually move in to any neighborhood. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, two randomly picked neighborhoods viz. Agincourt, Cedarbrae are compared and analyzed the top 10 most common venues in each of those two neighborhoods based on the number of visits by people in each of those places. \n",
    "\n",
    "Normally people tend to explore the places before moving to a new country, state, city or place for their work or to start a new life and that involves so many factors including neighborhood analysis. That calls for a search algorithm that usually returns the requested features such as population rate, median house price, school ratings, crime rates, weather conditions, recreational facilities etc. It would be nice to have a hassle-free application that could spit out an extensive analysis of all these features for a neighborhood or a comparative analysis between neighborhoods with just sending out the names of the neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data used and APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Datasets used*:\n",
    "\n",
    "BeautifulSoup package has been used to transform the data in the table on the Wikipedia page into the pandas dataframe\n",
    "\n",
    "The Wikipedia page, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M, has been used in order to obtain the neighborhood data along with postal codes and transformed the data into a pandas dataframe\n",
    "\n",
    "*Foursquare API*:\n",
    "\n",
    "This project would use Four-square API as its prime data gathering source as it has a database of more than 105 million places, especially their places API which provides the ability to perform location search, location sharing and details about a business. Photos, tips and reviews jolted by Foursquare users can also be used in many productive ways to add value to the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Foursquare API* search feature would be enabled to collect the nearby places of the neighborhoods. Due to http request limitations the number of places per neighborhood parameter would reasonably be set to 100 and the radius parameter would be set to 700.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Folium*- Python visualization library would be used to visualize the neighborhoods cluster distribution of Seattle city over an interactive leaflet map.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensive comparative analysis of two randomly picked neighborhoods world be carried out to derive the desirable insights from the outcomes using python’s scientific libraries Pandas, NumPy and Scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised machine learning algorithm K-mean clustering has been applied to form the clusters of different categories of places residing in and around the neighborhoods.\n",
    "These clusters from each of those two chosen neighborhoods would be analyzed individually collectively and comparatively to derive the conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python packages and Dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pandas \t- \tLibrary for Data Analysis\n",
    "- NumPy \t– \tLibrary to handle data in a vectorized manner\n",
    "- JSON \t– \tLibrary to handle JSON files\n",
    "- Geopy\t– \tTo retrieve Location Data \n",
    "- Requests \t– \tLibrary to handle http requests\n",
    "- Matplotlib\t– \tPython Plotting Module\n",
    "- Sklearn \t– \tPython machine learning Library\n",
    "- Folium \t– \tMap rendering Library\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology: \n",
    "\n",
    "K-mean clustering unsupervised machine learning algorithm has been used to cluster the neighborhoods based on the place category such as restaurants, park, coffee shop, gym etc. This would give a better understanding of the similarities and dissimilarities between the two chosen neighborhoods to retrieve more insights and to conclude with ease which neighborhood wins over other.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Two neighborhoods viz Agincourt, Cedarbraeto are compared on the following parameters*:\n",
    "1. More Indian Population\n",
    "2. Higher School Rating\n",
    "3. Reasonable Housing Price in the Range of 150k to 500k\n",
    "4. Comfortable Neighborhoods"

    "\n",
    "This Analysis concludes that compared to Agincourt, Cedarbrae has the higher number of Indian population, good school rating of 9 and a reasonable avg housing price of around 360K ,also top 10 common venues shows Cedarbrae has got a good neighborhood with Indian Restaurant, Cafe Shop, Bakery Shop,  Hakka Restaurant etc. Hence Cedarbrae wins over Agincourt!\n",
